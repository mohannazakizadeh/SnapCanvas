    ///   - maxConcurrentOperations: the number of concurrent network operation we can execute. If not specified is managed
    ///                              by the operation system and you don't need to set a value unless you have some other constraints.
    ///   - configuration: `URLSession` configuration. The available types are `default`,
    ///                    `ephemeral` and `background`, if you don't provide any or don't have
    ///                     special needs then Default will be used.
    ///
    ///                     - `default`: uses a persistent disk-based cache (except when the result is downloaded to a file)
    ///                     and stores credentials in the userâ€™s keychain.
    ///                     It also stores cookies (by default) in the same shared cookie store as the
    ///                     NSURLConnection and NSURLDownload classes.
    ///                     - `ephemeral`: similar to a default session configuration object except that
    ///                     the corresponding session object does not store caches,
    ///                     credential stores, or any session-related data to disk. Instead,
    ///                     session-related data is stored in RAM.
    ///                     - `background`: suitable for transferring data files while the app runs in the background.
    ///                     A session configured with this object hands control of the transfers over to the system,
    ///                     which handles the transfers in a separate process.
    ///                     In iOS, this configuration makes it possible for transfers to continue even when
    ///                     the app itself is suspended or terminated.
